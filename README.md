# knn-naives
This week's project requires us to implement a K-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier  and a Naive Bayes classifier. Once we conduct the experiments, we will calculate the resulting metrics:
* Compute the accuracy (percentage of correct classification).
* Report the confusion matrix of each classifier.
* Repeat step 2 to step 4 twice, each time splitting the datasets differently i.e. 70-30, 60-40, then note the outcomes of your modeling.
* Suggest and apply at least one of the optimization techniques that you learned earlier this week.
* Provide further recommendations to improve both classifiers.
